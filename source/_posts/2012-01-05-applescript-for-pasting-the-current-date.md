I'm a big fan of taking notes with [Evernote](http://evernote.com) and wanted a way to **paste the current date time** into the note, or for that matter into anything I was working on.

##### Inspiration
The basic instructions for getting this setup can be found [here.](http://blog.fosketts.net/2010/08/09/assign-keyboard-shortcut-applescript-automator-service/)

##### Making the workflow
Create a simple service in Apple Automator that **receives no input** in **any application**, save it as something like ``"paste_date"``:

##### The Code
Here is the code I used:

    set newTxt to ((current date) as string)
    set the clipboard to newTxt
    tell application "System Events" to keystroke "v" using {command down}


##### Creating the Shortcut
In the **Keyboard Preferences** create a new shortcut for this service:

That's it! Now in any application you can just press **command-shift-d** and paste the date:

``Thursday, January 5, 2012 10:47:22 AM``
