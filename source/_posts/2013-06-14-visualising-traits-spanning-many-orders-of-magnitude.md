Plant traits can vary across a considerable size range. Traits such as wood density, leaf mass per area, leaf lifespan and leaf nitrogen may vary 1-2 orders of magnitude across species, while others such as seed size, vessel size, leaf size and maximum height may vary many more. In an upcoming talk, I would like to visualise this variation, but how?

<!-- more -->

The challenge is to give the audience a feel for the true range of variation, but this can be difficult when objects span several orders of magnitude in size.

# Inspiration from astronomy

I described the problem to my colleague Rich FitzJohn. Rich, always full of good ideas, suggested that I investigate how people represent the size of the universe. Early in my search I came across Steven Strogatz's intriguing article in the NYTimes on [Visualizing vastness](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/visualizing-vastness/), which led me to several interesting examples.

## Powers of Ten

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Considering how to visualise many orders of magnitude, came across this classic video: Powers of Ten, by Eames 1977 - <a href="http://t.co/ltrKrXeC7a" title="http://bit.ly/17KyrR9">bit.ly/17KyrR9</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Falster (@adaptive_plant) <a href="https://twitter.com/adaptive_plant/status/345303482468818944">June 13, 2013</a></blockquote>

The amazing [Powers of Ten video](http://bit.ly/17KyrR9),  made in 1977

{% blockquote Powers of Ten http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0 youtube %}
takes us on an adventure in magnitudes. Starting at a picnic by the lakeside in Chicago, this famous film transports us to the outer edges of the universe. Every ten seconds we view the starting point from ten times farther out until our own galaxy is visible only a s a speck of light among many others. Returning to Earth with breathtaking speed, we move inward- into the hand of the sleeping picnicker- with ten times more magnification every ten seconds. Our journey ends inside a proton of a carbon atom within a DNA molecule in a white blood cell.
{% endblockquote %}

Along similar lines, the [powersof10  website](http://www.powersof10.com/) offers an interactive version. 

The powers of ten video and website succeed by re-framing a simple scene by showing it within ever-larger and then smaller contexts. As [Jamer Hunt suggests](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662461/how-to-apply-eamess-legendary-powers-of-10-to-real-life-problems) people are perhaps more comfortable with the idea of scale than they were when Eames film first appeared, because the re-framing technique has been repeated several times, most notably in technologies such as google earth and maps, with allow most of us to do some re-framing on a daily basis with our phones.

But of course, re-framing requires video, which is not ideal for a talk. 

## Carl Sagan walk

[Strogatz also talks about the Carl Sagan walk](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/visualizing-vastness/), where the planets are represented at real scale somewhere in NY. Where the powers of 10 uses a “multiscale” representation, the Carl-sagan walk "succeeds because its designers chose the right reduction factor and because the six orders of magnitude in the solar system happen to be within our perceptual power to grasp all at once."" 

I think the key here is that we are able to perceive scale much better in 3D than we are looking at a 2D picture.

I like this one, by xkcd artist Randall Munroe, which shows [all The Planets We Know About, Drawn To Scale](http://www.cbc.ca/strombo/technology-1/infographic-all-the-planets-we-know-about-drawn-to-scale.html).

# Examples with traits

Mark westoby  suggests best expressed in terms of function interested in.
SLA - LIGHT CPATURE PER DYR MASS  
Vessel size - conductivity per unit area lumen
