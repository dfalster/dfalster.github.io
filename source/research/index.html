problems:
  - "Our legacy product is a mess, but we have to maintain it. There are no tests, and new features are taking longer and longer to release."
  - "We've grown our team massively, but everyone is still doing their own thing. We need consistency with our processes."
  - "How can we figure out if this is the right thing to build, without wasting a lot of development time?"
  - "No one knows exactly what we are building, how can we increase communication within our team?"
  - "Every environment is different, we waste so much time troubleshooting our infrastructure."
  - "Test driven development sounds great, but it won't work here. Our developers are too entrenched and we have deadlines."
